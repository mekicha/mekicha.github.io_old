Thanks to a wonderful guide by [David Burela] on how to setup [jekyll] on Windows and an amazing tutorial on using [jekyll] by [Tania], I can now boast of having this blog up and running after poring over the internet searching for a step by step tutorial on how to do this thing. Mind you,by poring I mean that I looked up a couple of search results on google, closing some of them immediately I realized they were not what I was looking for.  
Oh, and thanks to the official [jekyll-docs]. Really well written. I picked up what I needed almost immediately. Thanks guys!
Now that this horrendous task of setting up is done, let me now turn my attention to the main art of blogging, and see how far this thing takes us. 
But before then, a good night rest is perfectly in order now. See you some other time.
